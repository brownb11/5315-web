      <h2>What is Docker?</h2>

      <p>Docker is a technilogically more efficient replacement for Virtual Machines.
Virtual Machines work by creating an example of hardware virtually (as if someone is working in an entirely new computer). VM's require a significant amount of computing resources to accomplish their task. Containers are a subet of this that share an operating system, because a new operating system does not need to be created for each instance the size is much smaller and the speed much greater for containers vs. VM's.
Docker manages the creation and maintenance of containers. While containers themselves have been around for quite some time Docker's proposition is standardization that breaks down communication barriers between coding languages. This allows more applications to be tested using the same resources at faster pace.</p>
